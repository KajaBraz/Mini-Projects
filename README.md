# Mini-Projects
At the time being, the repository contains the following:
- Analog Clock: a clock face with moving hands developed in JavaScript;
- Books Similarity: given some text files (ex. books), the programme calculates the texts' similarities and shows the similarity scores of each text pair in a dataframe. A book title can be passed to a function and the programme will create a chart with the similarity scores of all other books given. Here, we take as an example Charles Darwin's books;
- Data Structures: the implementation of tree, graph, heap, hash map, linked list, which have been used in the Wilderness Escape Adventure Game and Blossom - Flowers Definitions;
- Exam Question Drawer: a simple application for oral exams that displays the available sets of questions; the teachers loads the .txt file with questions to the application, the sets' numbers are displayed as green tiles, once a tile is clicked (after the student's choice), it becomes gray and the respective questions are shown on the page. The teacher has the possibility to download the exam's logs;

- Insight Into Texts: a programme that allows you to investigate texts by extracting phrases that follow given patterns. It uses some NLP techniques such as part-of-speech tagging and chunking;
- K-Means Clustering algorithm used to cluster colours of an image: the goal of the project is to apply the K-Means algorithm to find the minimum number of clusters, to reduce the number of the image's colours and to simplify it, while preserving all the picture's features;

- Random Walker: random movements simulation in which the object starts the walk at position (0, 0) and moves in random directions a given number of steps; the steps follow the standard normal distribution; the X-displacement and Y-displacement of a each step are independent from each other (horizontal and vertical displacements are not influenced); 10, 100, 500, 1000, and 10000 steps represenations of random walks are provided;

- Topic Extraction: given a set of texts, the programme provides a basic insight on the topic of each of them (it gives you a clue what they are about) by calculating the tf-idf score and showing the term with the highest score, i.e. the keyword, for each text;
- Web Article Analysis: an application that takes a website's url and provides an insight into its content using different NLP techniques.
